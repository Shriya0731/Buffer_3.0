Our project implenments priority queue.
We have used MySql database to save information about receivers, hospitals.
Receivers are registered in hospitals and their blood group and organ requirement are also fed in the database.
When a donor registers , we search a suitable receiver in hospitals in the area of donor.
Each hospital has a priority queue of receivers depending on the emergency status of the receiver prescribed by the doctor.
Donor is matched with the Receiever prioritywise and by matching blood group and organ requirement.
